# 1) Can there be a growing scarcity without a growing shortage—or a growing shortage without a growing scarcity? Explain with examples.

- Definitions
  - **Shortage**
  is a temporary situation where the quantity demanded of a good or service exceeds its quantity supplied at the *current market price*. This is usually caused by market conditions such as a sudden spike in demand, a disruption in supply, or government intervention (like price controls) 

  - **Scarcity**
  refers to the basic economic problem that resources are limited while human wants are unlimited. It is a naturally occurring, permanent condition that exists because there is a finite amount of resources (like land, water, oil, or time) to meet infinite human needs and desires

Shortage and scarcity are independent of each other. There can be shortage without scarcity and vice-versa. 

- **Example of shortage without scarcity:**

    When rent controls are placed in the housing markets a shortage occurs even though there might be enough physical housing space available for all the people to be accommodated (no scarcity).

    This is because **at low prices demand increases**. People who would on the face of rising prices be forced to share housing can now afford to keep the entire place to themselves. At the same time people on the search for housing find it extremely hard to find a place. 

    Clearly, this is shortage not scarcity. 

- **Example of scarcity without shortage**

    Consider the example given in the book of the San Francisco earthquake of fire of 1906. More than half the city's houses were destroyed causing scarcity of housing. Yet, there was no shortage. 

    This was because in the absence of rent controls, prices were allowed to rise and renters left without a home had incentives to use lesser space and those with space in their homes had incentives to take in people. 

    Also, **rising prices increase supply**. In this case the rising prices also made building new houses feasible. 

# 2) Can a decision be economic, if there is no money involved? Why or why not?

A decision can absolutely be economic even if no money is involved. Economics is fundamentally the study of how people make choices under conditions of scarcity, which means deciding how to allocate limited resources—such as time, effort, or opportunities—not just money

Recall the example, given in the book about a military medical team arriving on a battlefield to treat injured soldiers. The team is confronted with the classic economic problem of allocating scarce resources that have alternative uses. 

There are seldom enough medical staff to treat all wounded soldiers. Some soldiers might have mild injuries that might self-heal even if they aren't given immediate medical attention, others might survive if given immediate medical attention, still others unfortunately might not survive even if given the required medical attention. The medical staff has to thus decide how best to allocate the resources at its disposal. 

# 3)Can there be surplus food in a society where people are hungry? Explain why or why not.

Yes. When the government sets floor prices for food items it guarantees that if market prices under supply and demand caused the food price to drop below the government set price, the government will buy up what the market is unwilling to. 

**When prices are high, supply increases and demand decreases.** Due to the artificially enhanced food prices supply increases leading to a surplus. At the same time demand decreases since people in the poorest sections of society cannot afford to buy sufficient food at artificially high prices. This causes people to go hungry while the government buys up the unsold food items that went unsold in the market under the higher prices. 

# 4) When a housing shortage suddenly disappears, within a time period too short for any new housing to have been built, and yet people no longer have any trouble finding a vacant home or apartment, what has probably happened? What will probably happen in the longer run? Explain.

Assume that rent control laws were applicable earlier that lead to the shortage in housing in the first place. 

When rent control laws are ended, housing prices are no longer kept artificially low. The ensuing price rise causes the people who were occupying much larger apartments than they actually need to shift to smaller spaces or share their apartment with renters. 

Without rent control laws in the long run assuming increasing demand, prices go up. Since, increased prices lead to increased supply building new houses becomes profitable. This was not the case under rent control laws as the artificially lowered prices decreased supply of new housing as well. 

# 5) Which of the following are—or are not—affected by price controls that limit how high the product’s price can go: (a) the quantity supplied, (b) the quantity demanded, (c) the quality of the product, (d) a black market for the product, (e) hoarding of the product, (f) the supply of auxiliary services that usually go with the product, or (g) efficiency in the allocation of resources? Explain in each case. (a: pages 41–44; b: pages 39–41; c: pages 49–50, 51–53; d: pages 50–51, 53; e: pages 48–49; f: page 42; g: pages 52–53, 64–65)

- **a) Do price ceilings affect quantity supplied?**

    Yes. Price ceilings artificially lower prices. At lower prices supply decreases. 

- **b) Do price ceilings affect quantity demanded?**

    Yes. At lower prices quantity demanded increases. 

- **c) Do price ceilings affect the quality of the product?** 

    Yes. Artificially lowered prices under price ceilings cause an increase in the quantity demanded and reduction in the quantity supplied. 

    Some items that under free market conditions would be disposed as being low quality might be continued to be sold when price ceilings are implemented. This is because the shopkeepers know that the quantity demanded is high anyway and whichever price-controlled item is on the shelf will be sold anyway. Hence, they choose to not waste time (and money) sorting the quality of the price-controlled item and choose to use their time (scarce resource) somewhere else (alternative uses).

- **d) Do price ceilings lead to black markets?**

    Price ceilings lead to shortages. Though it may be legally forbidden to purchase price-controlled items at a higher than set price, individuals may regardless still choose to do so since it is mutually beneficial (the seller gets to make more money while the buyer gets a way around the shortage to get the good they desire). The black market prices are usually more than the prices would have been in a free market since the legal risks also have to be compensated. 

- **e) Do price ceilings cause hoarding of the product?**
