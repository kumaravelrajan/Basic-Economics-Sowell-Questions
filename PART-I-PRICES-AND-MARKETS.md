### Can there be a growing scarcity without a growing shortageâ€”or a growing shortage without a growing scarcity? Explain with examples. (38, 47-48)

- Definitions
  - *Shortage* 
  is a temporary situation where the quantity demanded of a good or service exceeds its quantity supplied at the *current market price*. This is usually caused by market conditions such as a sudden spike in demand, a disruption in supply, or government intervention (like price controls) 

  - *Scarcity*
  Scarcity refers to the basic economic problem that resources are limited while human wants are unlimited. It is a naturally occurring, permanent condition that exists because there is a finite amount of resources (like land, water, oil, or time) to meet infinite human needs and desires

Shortage and scarcity are independent of each other. There can be shortage without scarcity and vice-versa.
